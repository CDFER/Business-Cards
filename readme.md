Meet my PCB business cards, a collection of functional devices that showcase my passion for embedded electronics and microcontrollers. Each card is a unique project that demonstrates a specific concept or technology, from a simple USB cable tester to a complex LED matrix display. By sharing these projects, I hope to connect with like-minded individuals, inspire new ideas, and have too much fun along the way!
